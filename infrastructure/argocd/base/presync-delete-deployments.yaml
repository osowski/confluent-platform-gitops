# PreSync Hook to delete Deployments with immutable selectors
# This allows Helm to recreate them with the correct selector labels
#
# This hook runs BEFORE the main sync, deleting existing Deployments
# so they can be recreated with updated selectors.
#
# To enable this hook, add it to the Application's source path or
# include it in the Helm chart's templates directory.
